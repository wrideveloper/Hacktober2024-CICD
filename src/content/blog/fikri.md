## Profile

Fikri Muhammad Abdillah, a wanderer in the world of technology, has found his place among lines of code, late-night debugging sessions, and endless cups of black coffee. Fikri wears many hats: a tech enthusiast, an active open-source contributor, and a big dreamer set on innovation. Behind his calm smile is a fiery spirit, especially during Hacktoberfest. For him, Hacktoberfest '24 is a unique year—a time to make as many contributions as possible in the online collaboration space and spread the passion for CI/CD.

Behind the scenes, Fikri is a loyal CI/CD advocate, dreaming of a world where each commit is part of a harmonious symphony of perfect releases. Collaboration is his native language—he believes that building something together brings far more satisfaction than working alone. To him, CI/CD isn’t just technology; it’s an art form involving team synchronization, continuous improvement, and infinite patience.

Fikri’s quirky spirit often shows up between his tasks. Once, he tried to create a program to guess someone’s mood based on typing speed alone. While the experiment didn’t quite pan out, Fikri believes that every experimental step is part of becoming a better developer.

In his spare time, he’s dedicated to teaching new students the importance of collaboration, running seminars on CI/CD, and efficient application development. Fikri is the kind of person who could talk at length about how Git merge conflicts should be considered an art form rather than a problem. In fact, he once joked that every merge conflict is an opportunity to learn balance in life—and perhaps even in the galaxy.

Fikri aspires to become a "code artisan" rather than just a programmer. Every project, to him, is a blank canvas, ready to be filled with brilliant ideas, and every bug is a chance to evolve. He hopes that each line of code he writes will have an impact, even a small one, on the vast world of technology.
