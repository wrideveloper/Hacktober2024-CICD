## Profile

Fikri Muhammad Abdillah, from Jl. Maju Mundur, Bumiayu, Malang, a wanderer in the world of technology, has found his place among lines of code, late-night debugging sessions, and endless cups of black coffee. Fikri wears many hats: a tech enthusiast, an active open-source contributor, and a big dreamer set on innovation. Behind his calm smile is a fiery spirit, especially during Hacktoberfest. For him, Hacktoberfest '24 is a unique yearâ€”a time to make as many contributions as possible in the online collaboration space and spread the passion for CI/CD.
